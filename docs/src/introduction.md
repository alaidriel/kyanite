# Introduction

> Languages are cool! Compilers are cool! How do they work? That's why this project exists: Kyanite is a statically-typed, compiled programming language to learn more about how PLs are created. The primary backend is LLVM, and a custom backend targeting x86_64 (kyir) is in early stages of development.

Welcome to the Kyanite docs! See the sidebar for an overview of what's here, particularly the [language reference](./reference.md).
