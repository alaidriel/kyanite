# Introduction

> Languages are cool! Compilers are cool! How do they work? That's why this project exists: Kyanite is a statically-typed, compiled programming language to learn more about how PLs are created. The current (only) backend is LLVM, but I may pursue adding a custom backend in the future.

Welcome to the Kyanite docs! See the sidebar for an overview of what's here, particularly the [language reference](./reference.md).
